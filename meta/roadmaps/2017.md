# 2017 Roadmap

This is a work in progress

**tldr**: First goal is to fix leftover bugs/inconsistencies to have a proper demo version, afterwards a usability overhaul will happen using the knowledge gained in making the demo version, followed by another stage of bugfixing to release a first stable public version.

**Main stages**:

**Stage 1**: Improvements to initial release

**Stage 2**: Major overhaul

**Stage 3**: Stability

## Stage 1: Improvements to initial release

The goal is to fix bugs/inconsistencies in order to have a demo-able version to increase interest in the project. To be able to develop the next stage I will probably have to look for some funds to make it happen in a timely fashion due to the relatively large scope of the project.

Main work items:
* A demo page (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/60)

See the accompanying [milestone](https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/milestone/1) for individual tasks.

## Stage 2: Major overhaul

After having a stable first demo release and (hopefully) having gathered an audience, it will be time to take everything that was learned from creating the innitial release, to do a design overhaul and focus on usability.

The main work items in this stage are the following:
* Design overhaul (responsiveness and overall design) (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/74)
* Graph redesign (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/29)
* Sharing of graph components (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/11)
* Transitions between graphs (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/47)
* Semi-automation of inbox nodes (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/65)
* Export functionality (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/53)

See the accompanying [milestone](https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/milestone/2) for individual tasks.

## Stage 3: Stability
In this stage the focus will be on creating a stable release and polishing the work that has been done in the previous stage, which includes:
* Increase code test coverage
* Improving installation documentation
* Improve overall code quality
