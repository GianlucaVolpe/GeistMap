# 2017 Roadmap

This is a work in progress

**Main stages**:

**Stage 1**: Design overhaul

**Stage 2**: Fixing leftover bugs and usability issues

**Stage 3**: Work on introduction material

**Stage 4**: Stability

**Stage 5**: Add more advanced features

## Stage 1: Design overhaul

The goal of this stage is to focus on usability of the software. In its current state the system is not very intuitive and needs work to provide a more intuitive workflow.

The main work items in this stage are the following:
* Design overhaul (responsiveness and overall design) (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/74)
* Graph redesign (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/29)
* Transitions between graphs (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/47)

See the accompanying [milestone](https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/milestone/2) for individual tasks.

## Stage 2: Fixing leftover bugs and usability issues

These bugs are not directly related to design and need to be fixed.

See the accompanying [milestone](https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/milestone/1) for individual tasks.

## Stage 3: Work on introduction material

After the design has been fixed to be more intuitive for first-time users, introduction material should be made to show the capabilities of the system at scale.

Main work items:
* Improved landing page
* A demo page (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/60)

## Stage 4: Stability
In this stage the focus will be on creating a stable release and polishing the work that has been done in the previous stage, which includes:
* Increase code test coverage
* Improving installation documentation
* Improve overall code quality

## Stage 5: More advanced features
After having a stable release, more advanced features can be implemented.

* Sharing of graph components (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/11)
* Semi-automation of inbox nodes (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/65)
* Export functionality (https://github.com/bryanph/Geist/issues/53)
* Import functionality
