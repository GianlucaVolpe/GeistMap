Hey Alexander,

When I was looking for a PKB solution a few months ago I ran into your article. It has helped me a lot in determining what is out there, thanks! I have also looked for a way to organize my learning digitally for a long time but never found a good fit for me.

I noticed you set up a mailing list as part of your last blog post on PKBs. I was wondering if any initiatives or collaborations started as a result of this.

Looking forward to your reply.

Cheers, Bryan
